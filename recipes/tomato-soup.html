    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 slice onion</li>
      <li>4 whole cloves</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, onion, cloves and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
      <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
